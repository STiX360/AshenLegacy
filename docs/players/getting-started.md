# 🎮 Getting Started

Welcome to **Ashen Legacy**! This guide will help you get started in your first hour of gameplay, covering the most important tips, systems, and dangers to look out for as you enter this strange new world.

## 🧬 Step 1: Choose your origin

Upon first joining a world, you are prompted to select a starting origin, each with its own strengths, drawbacks, and unique abilities.
### 🔰 Tips for Choosing:

- **Human** – No bonuses or penalties. A good default if you want to explore freely.
    
- ~~**Avian** – Increased speed and slow-fall, but can’t eat meat and must stay airborne.~~
    
- ~~**Arachnid** – Climbs walls and traps mobs in cobwebs, but takes more damage from water.~~
    
- ~~**Enderian** – Teleports and resists projectiles, but hates water and is damaged by it.~~
    
- ~~**Merling** – Breathes underwater and moves fast in water, but suffocates on land.~~
    
- ~~**Blazeborn** – Immune to fire and lava, excels in Nether, but spawns in hostile areas.~~ 

You cannot freely change your origin after selection, so choose wisely!

## 🛠️ Step 2: Choose your class

After selecting your origin, you can select a class that can provide various abilities and passive boosts.  Classes are less drastic than origins, but can still influence your playstyle in meaningful ways.
- **Archer** – Your projectiles are more accurate and you are slowed less when using a bow.
    
- **Beastmaster** – Animals you tame gain extra hearts and damage; when you drink a potion, effects also apply to nearby tamed animals.
    
- **Blacksmith** – You can repair tools and armor more efficiently, both in an anvil and via crafting.
    
- **Cleric** – You can double the duration of potions; you are better at enchanting.
    
- **Cook** – Food you craft provides more nourishment; you gain extra XP from cooking food in a smoker.
    
- **Explorer** – You start the game with 9 empty maps, a compass, and a clock; you don’t exhaust from sprinting.
    
- **Farmer** – Bone meal is twice as effective when used by you; crops sometimes yield twice the loot when harvested.
    
- **Lumberjack** – Crafting planks from logs gives you two extra planks; you cut down whole trees at once when using an axe.
    
- **Merchant** – When you trade with villagers, they will trade more times before running out of stock; wandering traders give you special offers.
    
- **Miner** – You break all stone blocks faster; you don’t exhaust from mining blocks.
    
- **Nitwit** – You’re not particularly good at anything.
    
- **Rancher** – When breeding animals, they sometimes produce twins; animals killed by you can drop twice as much loot.
    
- **Rogue** – Your name is never visible through walls; you enter stealth after sneaking for 10 seconds, making less sound and dealing double damage from behind.
    
- **Warrior** – You deal +1 attack damage with every weapon; you are slowed less when using a shield.

Each class enhances a core playstyle. Like your origin, you cannot freely change it after selection, so choose based on how you plan to play—whether gathering, supporting, or fighting.

A Warrior Enderian will play very differently than a Cleric Merling. Look for synergy between your Origin and your Class that complements your Origin or reinforces your favorite in-game role — whether it's combat, support, or gathering.

## 📈 Step 3: Early Progression

When starting your adventure in Ashen Legacy, you'll be guided through the **Progression** tab of the **Quests** interface (there is a button in your Inventory screen). This is where you'll choose your **starting [Aptitudes](aptitudes)** (like Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, etc.) and begin shaping your character build.

- You're given a set of **starting Aptitude options**—choose ones that reflect your preferred playstyle.
    
- These attributes directly influence XP gain, relic synergy, and progression benefits.
    

### 🎯 Starting Skill Tree Points

- You will also receive **5 skill points** to allocate in your custom skill tree.
    
- Open your skill tree (check keybinds or quest prompts) and begin unlocking passive bonuses.
    
- Early picks might include:
    
    - Increased health or stamina regen
        
    - Faster harvesting or mining
        
    - Improved relic interaction
        

Choose wisely—while the tree can be expanded later, these first few picks will shape your early survivability and effectiveness.

## 🧪 Step 4: First Potions & Upgrades

- Brew basic **Mystic Brews**:
    
    - Found in swamp ruins or purchased from Goblin Traders
        
    - Grants temporary buffs like night vision, slow fall, or extra XP gain
        
- Enhance early gear:
    
    - Salvage enchanted loot for **relic dust**
        
    - Trade with villagers or goblins for overcapped gear
        

## 🧙 Step 5: Know Your Enemies

- Blood Moons will happen—build defenses early:
    
    - Light up your base
        
    - Build fences and traplines
        
- Dungeon bosses **scale with time**:
    
    - Don’t rush ruins if undergeared
        
    - Use hit-and-run tactics, ranged weapons, or allies
        

## 🌍 Optional Goals (First Day)

- Find and light your first **shrine**
    
- Harvest from 3+ unique biomes for aptitude bonuses
    
- Discover your first **vault fragment** (used to unlock deeper dungeons)
    

Ashen Legacy rewards cautious exploration, slow buildup, and creative strategy. Good luck—your legacy begins now.
