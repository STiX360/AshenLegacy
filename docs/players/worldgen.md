# 🌍 World Generation & Exploration

The world of Ashen Legacy is rich with danger, treasure, and beauty, reshaped by numerous structural and environmental enhancements. Exploration is central to the experience, with countless secrets hidden across the Overworld, Nether, and End.

## Underground Realms

### 📦 Enhanced Caves

Two new cave biomes have been added:

- **Frosted Caves** are slick, frozen expanses with embedded ice traps.
	- [Creeping Ice](items#creeping-ice) 'creeps' to nearby blocks in the biome to cover them in a slippery sheen.
	- [Frost Lilies](items#frost-lilies) emit a faint light throughout the cave, but perhaps it holds another use?
	- [Icicles](items#icicles) can be found hanging from the ceiling.
	- [Enchanted Ice](items#enchanted-ice) is hidden away, and can provide experience when mined.
	- [Skeletons](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Skeleton) that enter the biome will turn into [Strays](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stray).
    
- **Lost Caves** are caves where the ancient desert sands have blown in over the ages.
	- [Ancient Sand](items#ancient-sand) can be found in the layers of the walls of the cave
	- [Prickly Peach Cacti](items#prickly-peach-cacti)
	- [Prickly Vines](items#prickly-vines)
	- [Sand Snappers](mobs#sand-snapper)
	- and finally, sandstorms...

Expect biome-matching materials, ambient lighting, and the occasional relic chamber tucked deep inside.

### 🏰 Mega-Dungeons

Randomly generated multi-level dungeons filled with:

- Mob spawners
    
- Puzzle rooms
    
- Hidden loot behind false walls
    
- Boss rooms with elite enemies and powerful item drops
    

These dungeons often contain relics—powerful artifacts offering unique passive or triggered effects.

## Surface Structures

### 🏞️ Reimagined Temples and Fortresses

Each major vanilla structure has been overhauled:

- **Jungle Temples** are now sprawling ruins with redstone traps and underground crypts.
    
- **Desert Temples** extend deeper underground and feature multi-stage puzzles.
    
- **Nether Fortresses** rise taller, with narrow ledges, vertical towers, and custom mobs.
    

### 🌉 Procedural Bridges & Ruins

In naturally broken terrain, ancient bridges now spawn—wooden or stone, weathered by time. Some hide chests or hint at old paths connecting larger ruins or dungeons.

### 📜 Map Fragments

Players may discover torn map pieces pointing to unmarked locations like:

- Secret shrines
    
- Collapsed vaults
    
- Wandering trader altars

# 🧰 Items, Artifacts & Loot

Gear and equipment in Ashen Legacy goes beyond swords and armor—exploration and combat reward players with magical relics, rare drops, and visual enhancements.

## 🔮 Relics

Relics are ancient items that offer powerful, often passive abilities:

- **Phoenix Feather** – Revives the player once per day
    
- **Gravity Rune** – Increases jump height and reduces fall damage
    
- **Whispershard** – Occasionally casts a random spell when struck
    

Relics cannot be crafted and are usually found in mega-dungeons or locked vaults.

## 🌈 Loot Visibility

To prevent valuable items from being missed:

- **Loot beams** shine colored lights above rare items.
    
- Beam color and visibility range is configurable per item type or mod origin.
    

## 📦 Boss & Dungeon Loot

Elite enemies and bosses often drop:

- High-tier enchanted gear (some exceeding vanilla enchantment limits)
    
- Relics or map fragments
    
- Themed cosmetic items or resources used to trade with goblins
    

## 🏷️ Goblin Trading

Goblins spawn deep underground or in the Nether. These neutral traders offer:

- Overpowered gear
    
- Trade-only enchantments
    
- Extremely rare blocks
    

Engage quickly—goblins despawn when out of range and don't reappear in the same place.
