## 🧩 Key Features

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install using the [CurseForge app](https://www.curseforge.com/download) (we recommend the standalone client) or import the pack manually into your mod manager of choice. Make sure to:

1. Allocate **6-10GB RAM** for stable performance.
2. Use **Java 17+**.
3. Wait patiently on *first* launch—250+ mods take a moment to load!
