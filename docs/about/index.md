# About

**Ashen Legacy** was born out of a desire for a mod-pack that combined a number of RPG gameplay elements into a pack with balanced progression and with a finer grain of quality control (e.g. avoiding structure generation issues that ruin immersion) that the community would want to play.

Whilst the addition of new creatures, structures, and capabilities is a slow process, we take our time to ensure they're integrated in a balanced and immersive way with the wider pack.
