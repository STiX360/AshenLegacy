## Compressed Blocks
Certain resource blocks (Iron Block, Cobblestone, etc.) can now be compressed up to 9 times to save storage space.  Compressed blocks can always be uncompressed back to their original components.

When paired with a Compacting Upgrade in your storage or backpack, it allows for millions of blocks to be stored in an extremely dense space.
