# Items

## Blocks

### Enchanted Ice
Provides experience when mined, or can serve as a delicate light source.
### Creeping Ice
A slippery surface that covers blocks.  It can spread in [Frosted Caves](worldgen#enhanced-caves) biomes to nearby blocks.
### Compressed Blocks
Certain resource blocks (Iron Block, Cobblestone, etc.) can now be compressed up to 9 times to save storage space.  Compressed blocks can always be uncompressed back to their original components.

When paired with a Compacting Upgrade in your storage or backpack, it allows for millions of blocks to be stored in an extremely dense space.
### Frost Lilies 
Emit a soft light, but can also be used as an ingredient to make the [Potion of Frost](#potion-of-frost).
### Icicles
Icicles have a number of interesting properties:
- they can be dislodged with a projectile, allowing them to fall and hurt unsuspecting mobs
- they can be placed above a [cauldron](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cauldron), allowing water to drip down and fill it up (similar to how [pointed dripstone stalactites](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pointed_Dripstone#Stalactites) function with lava)
- they can act as ammunition for [crossbows](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Crossbow)
### Ancient Sand
A new decorative block found in the [Lost Caves](worldgen#enhanced-caves) that can be crafted into slabs, stairs, etc.
### Prickly Peach Cacti
These small cactus plants grow [Prickly Peaches](#prickly-peaches) that you can harvest to snack on, but beware their prick.  They are able to be placed in [Flower Pots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Flower_Pot).
### Prickly Vines
A new vegetation that can be dangerous to path through, but can be used to climb up certain spaces.

## Food

### Prickly Peaches
It might be a tasty snack, but is the taste be worth the prick?

## Potions

### Potion of Frost
Applies the [Freezing effect](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Powder_Snow#Freezing), similar to [Powder Snow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Powder_Snow).  If you brew it further with [Gunpowder](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Gunpowder), it will also apply [Creeping Ice](#creeping-ice) in an area where it lands.
