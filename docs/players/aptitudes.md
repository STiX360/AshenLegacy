# Aptitudes
**Ashen Legacy** includes a lightweight but meaningful RPG progression system, built around the concept of **Aptitudes**. Aptitudes are attributes that gate passive and active effects, as well as your ability to use certain items. These attributes can be increased by spending experience to level them up.


üîì **How Aptitudes Are Used**

Aptitudes aren‚Äôt just passive stats‚Äîthey influence:

- Skill tree unlocks
- Relic usage or effectiveness
- Event and mob targeting priority (some mobs aggro based on Strength or Luck)
- Access to certain content gated by stat checks (e.g., relic vaults or shrine interactions)

## Strength
## Dexterity
## Intelligence
## Magic
## Constitution
## Defense
## Building
## Luck

## üõ†Ô∏è Tips for Building Aptitudes

- **Hybrid Build**: You can be a jack of all trades, if you're willing to be the master of none.
	- By spec'ing into multiple stats, you can obtain a well-rounded level of power.  Just enough Strength to wield that sword, just enough Intelligence to decipher that [Enchanted Book](items#enchanted-books), etc.
    
- **Specialist Builds**: Be the tank, be the builder, be whatever you want.
	- Focus on one or two actions consistently to create a strong identity.  A particularly strong approach for [party play](party).
	
- **Counter Build**: Alternatively, make up for your deficiencies.
	- If you're already great at combat, a few extra points of knockback or HP mightn't do much for you - consider how your points could be spent to reduce farming time at your base.
	- If you're a competent builder, but don't like combat - a few extra hearts might help you survive those Blood Moon events. 

There‚Äôs no wrong way to play‚Äîaptitudes ensure character's stats and abilities support your desired playstyle, making your character feel personal and powerful as you progress through Ashen Legacy.
